### Why React?

React is used to build user interfaces (UI) on the front end. React is a `JavaScript` library created by Facebook. It is used for building reusable UI components. React allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple. It works only on user interfaces in the application. This corresponds to the view in the MVC template. It can be used with a combination of other JavaScript libraries or frameworks, such as Angular JS in MVC.

### CDN

`CDN` stands for Content Delivery Network. Yah ek network hota hai jo aapke website ke static files jaise CSS, JS, Images ko store karta hai. Jab koi user aapki website ko open karta hai to CDN us static files ko user ke nearest server se load karta hai. Isse aapki website ki speed fast hoti hai.```

here are React CDN links:

````html
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
```

### Crossorigin attribute:
The crossorigin attribute is a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) setting that can be added to elements such as ```<img>```, ```<video>```, ```<audio>```, ```<link>```, ```<script>```, and ```<style>```. This attribute allows you to ```configure``` the CORS settings for those elements.
