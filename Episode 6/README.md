## Monolith Architecture
- Single codebase
- Single deployment
- Single database
- Single point of failure
- Single point of scaling

## Microservice Architecture
- It is a collection of small services
- Each service is self-contained
- Each service can be deployed independently
- Each service can be written in different languages
- Each service can have its own database

## Separation of concerns and single responsibity principle
- Each service should have a single responsibility
- Each service should be separated from other services
- Each service should be independent

how do these services interact with each other
