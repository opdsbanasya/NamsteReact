### Why React? 
```React is used to build user interfaces (UI) on the front end. React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook. It is used for building reusable UI components. React allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple. It works only on user interfaces in the application. This corresponds to the view in the MVC template. It can be used with a combination of other JavaScript libraries or frameworks, such as Angular JS in MVC.```

### What is CDN and crossorigin?
    #### CDN:
    ```CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. Yah ek network hota hai jo aapke website ke static files jaise CSS, JS, Images ko store karta hai. Jab koi user aapki website ko open karta hai to CDN us static files ko user ke nearest server se load karta hai. Isse aapki website ki speed fast hoti hai.```
    #### Crossorigin attribute:
    ```The crossorigin attribute is a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) setting that can be added to elements such as <img>, <video>, <audio>, <link>, <script>, and <style>. This attribute allows you to configure the CORS settings for those elements.```

### Library vs Framework? 
    #### Library:
    ```Library is a collection of functions and methods that allows you to perform many actions without writing your code. 
    bounded by less rules and guidelines.
    isme kuch changes karne ki freedom hoti hai.```
    #### Framework:
    ```Framework is a collection of libraries that helps you to perform many actions without writing your code.
    bounded by more rules and guidelines.
    isme kuch changes karne ki jyada freedom nahi hoti hai.```
```Frameworks and libraries are both code written by someone else that helps you perform some common tasks in a less verbose way.
A framework inverts the control of the program. It tells the developer what they need. A library doesn’t. The programmer calls the library where and when they need it.
The degree of freedom a library or framework gives the developer will dictate how “opinionated” it is.```
